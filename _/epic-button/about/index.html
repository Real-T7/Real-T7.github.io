  <h1>About the Epic Button ™</h1>
  <p>I made this website to honor the original Epic Button™ .</p>
    
  <p>
    When i was programming for my Discord bot, i thought it would be funny to include a Button that everyone can click on.
    But little did i know, it turned into a legend.
    Unfortunately, the Button sacrificed itself in a series of events.
    Thats why i made this website to revive the Button as a website.
