    <p>
      [REDACTED] is the place that contains the Experiments.
      <br>
      All of them have a identification code with the following format: S-xyz
      <br>
      S stands for "Subject", x is the Species and yz is the serial number for each individual of that Species.
      <br>
      The higher the serial number, the more similar that Experiment is to other Species.
      <br>
      Among the Experiments, only 2 have been freed by an unidentified person: S-762 and S-575
      <br>
