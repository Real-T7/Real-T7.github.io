    <p>
      i hate my life, because life hates me.
      <br>
      imagine standing with 99 other people in a game. no matter what, you are always the first person to lose.
      <br>
      or imagine just chilling in a park and suddenly, someone approaches and bullies you, and even threatens you, even though they dont know you.
      <br>
      those are the things that happen to me every day.
      <br>
      everyone hates me for no reason at all.
      <br>
      not only that, but the entire world hates me for no reason. none of my dreams or wishes come true, even if its nearly guranteed.
      <br>
      i dont have any *real* friends. i need a friend to talk to...
